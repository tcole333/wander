# Design measurements

Scripts, results, and notes cited by `docs/design/streaming.md` (as `[M]`, `[M proxy]`, or
`[model]`). They come from the 2026-09-24 design work: three independent designs (Claude, Codex,
Fable), two cross-reviews, and a verification pass. Paths match the citations in the design doc.

Most measurements ran on an Apple M5 using ETOPO or GEBCO windows as stand-ins, so they are proxies
for the target laptops; the design's experiments (section 8.2) replace them with real numbers.

`work/story-first/beats.py` holds the drafted Tambora beat list (camera footprints per beat), the
starting point for the first story.
